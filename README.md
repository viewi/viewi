<h2 align="center">A powerful tool for building full-stack and completely reactive web applications with PHP</h2>

Imagine Vue js or Angular but with similar user-friendly HTML templates and components but written in PHP. The application, which acts like a front-end framework and backend template engine simultaneously, renders identical contents on both sides. And you don't even need Node js. Isn't it awesome?

Works with a limited subset of PHP, but even then, it is still more than enough for building advanced web applications.

Short example:
--------
`Counter.php`
```php
<?php

namespace Application\Components\Views\Demo\SimpleComponent;

use Viewi\BaseComponent;

class Counter extends BaseComponent
{
    public int $count = 0;

    public function increment()
    {
        $this->count++;
    }
}
```
`Counter.html` 
```html
<button (click)="increment()">Clicked $count times.</button>
```
`Use it as a tag`:
```html
<Counter />
```
