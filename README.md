<h1 align="center">Viewi V2 [WIP]</h1>
<h2 align="center">A powerful tool for building full-stack and completely reactive web applications with PHP</h2>


<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/viewi/viewi/tree/v1">Click here for Viewi v1</a></h3>

Full-stack UI framework for PHP with reactivity on front-end and efficient SSR.

Viewi is not about avoiding javascript, it's about integration same code into both worlds for mutual benefits.

How? - by transpiling PHP/HTML code into javacript to fuel front-end.

Transpiling works with a limited subset of PHP (not everything can be converted into PHP), but even then, it is still more than enough for building advanced web applications. And if you need more custom JS - there is a way to inject it.

More description is coming.

### Viewi v1:

Short example:
--------
`Counter.php`
```php
<?php

namespace Application\Components\Views\Demo\SimpleComponent;

use Viewi\BaseComponent;

class Counter extends BaseComponent
{
    public int $count = 0;

    public function increment()
    {
        $this->count++;
    }
}
```
`Counter.html` 
```html
<button (click)="increment()">Clicked $count times.</button>
```
`Use it as a tag`:
```html
<Counter />
```
